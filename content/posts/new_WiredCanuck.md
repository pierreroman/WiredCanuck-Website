Hello folks,

It's been a while since I wrote on my own blog. I have been contributing to [CanITPro.net](https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/blogs/canitpro/?WT.mc_id=WiredCanuck-blog-pierrer) and [ITOpsTalk.com](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/bg-p/ITOpsTalkBlog?WT.mc_id=WiredCanuck-blog-pierrer) so I really had left my old blog behind.  It's been so long that I forgot the WordPress password I had on the old platform.  I decided to kill several birds with one stone.  I decided to build a markdown based, adaptive, static website and host it on [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=WiredCanuck-blog-pierrer).  I wanted to learn about Azure Static Web Apps anyway and I
needed the practice with managing code in Github.

I did find an article that helped in the [Azure Static Web Apps documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/?WT.mc_id=WiredCanuck-blog-pierrer).  Under the tutorial section, called Tutorial: [Publish a Hugo site to Azure Static Web Apps Preview](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/static-web-apps/publish-hugo?WT.mc_id=WiredCanuck-blog-pierrer).

Of course I could have picked any of the popular static site generators like:

1. Gatsby
1. VuePress
1. Jekyll

However I choose Hugo mostly because a web developer friend told me about it. and it sounded like it would fit my requirements.  I will be posting here and [ITOpsTalk.com](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/itops-talk-blog/bg-p/ITOpsTalkBlog?WT.mc_id=WiredCanuck-blog-pierrer).

Cheers!

Pierre
