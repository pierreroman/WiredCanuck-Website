# PIERRE ROMAN

Senior Cloud Advocate, Geek, and Public Speaker in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada

As a Cloud Ops Advocate, I engages with the operations and infrastructure communities on behalf of Microsoft. I'm part of a team that drives growth and adoptions of the Azure platform by providing upskilling guidance and by taking in feedback to take back to the product groups.

With over 25 years of experience in the industry, I brings a well-rounded view of all facets of the Ops/infra lifecycle. My experiences enable me to relate to my audiences and cultivate relationships at all levels (from the nuts and bolts guy/gal to management.)

I'm a husband, a dad, a hockey fan, a gadget freak and a geek.

I'm always ready for a conversation (in English or fran√ßais - naturellement).
